Hi, this is Yuanze (pronunciation: yuentsheh)! I am a first-year PhD student at Booth School of Business, University of Chicago. I am honored to work with [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/) and [Alex Koch](https://alexkoch.site/).

I study cultural evolution. One area of my research examines how human psychology (e.g., social evaluation, prejudice) evolves with social ecology, often in spontaneous and adaptive ways. Another area investigates how human societies intentionally shape their cultural evolution, for example, by deciding which practices to adopt, what ideas to spread, how information circulates, and how disagreements are managed. Taken together, My work aims to understand how we can build better forms of collective life.
