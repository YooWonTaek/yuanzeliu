Hi! this is Yuanze (pronunciation: [yuăn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:zh-yu%C7%8En.ogg) [zé](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:zh-z%C3%A9.ogg)). I am a first-year PhD student at Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, where I work with Prof. [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/).

I study cultural evolution. My research revolves around three broad questions. First, I ask why human psychology (e.g., person perception, prejudice) has taken its current form and how it co-evolves with social ecology (e.g., [state centralization](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zxuth), [globalization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/01461672231190753), [digitalization](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/ai_prioritization.pdf)) to keep humans adaptive. 

My second line of research investigates when cultural evolution malfunctions. As amazing as they are, human societies are complex systems that evolve without centralized design or foresight. Hence, what evolves can be adaptive under one context or evaluative criterion but malfunction when contexts or evaluation standards shift, especially as systems scale or evolve at different speeds. My research documents the evolutionary origin of these malfunctions, such as [loneliness epidemic](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx), [entrenched prejudice](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zxuth) and [inequality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pops.12927), [political polarization](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7cqfs_v3), and [resistance to cross-cultural communication](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/01461672231190753). 

Third, to address these puzzles, I study how human communities can intentionally steer their own cultural evolution—for example, by deciding [which practices to adopt](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7bqxp_v1), [what ideas to spread](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pops.12927), [how information circulates](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx), and [how disagreements are managed](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gfdwx_v1). 

In all three lines of work, I am interested in the cultural impact of new institutions and technologies (e.g., [large AI models](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx)).

Taken together, my work aims to understand how we can build better forms of collective life.
