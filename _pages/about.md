Hi! this is Yuanze (pinyin: [yuăn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:zh-yu%C7%8En.ogg) [zé](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:zh-z%C3%A9.ogg)). I am a first-year PhD student at Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, where I am honored to work with Prof. [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/).

I study cultural evolution. My research revolves around three broad questions. First, I ask why human psychology (e.g., human perception, prejudice) has taken its current form and how it co-evolves with social ecology (e.g., [state centralization](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zxuth), [globalization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/01461672231190753), [digitalization](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/ai_prioritization.pdf)) as people adapt to their environments. Yet human societies are complex systems rather than omniscient designers; what evolves can be adaptive under one context or evaluative criterion but malfunction when contexts or evaluation standards shift—especially as systems scale or evolve at different speeds. Accordingly, my second line of research investigates these malfunctions, such as the [loneliness epidemic](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx), [entrenched prejudice](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zxuth) and [inequality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pops.12927), [political polarization](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7cqfs_v3), and [backlash against globalization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/01461672231190753) in modern societies. Third, to address these puzzles, I study how human communities can intentionally steer their own cultural evolution—for example, by deciding [which practices to adopt](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7bqxp_v1), [what ideas to spread](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pops.12927), [how information circulates](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx), and [how disagreements are managed](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gfdwx_v1). I am particularly interested in the role of new institutions and technologies (e.g., [large AI models](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/hybridNetwork.docx)) in these processes.
Taken together, my work aims to understand how we can build better forms of collective life.
