Hi! this is Yuanze (pinyin: [yuăn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:zh-yu%C7%8En.ogg) [zé](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:zh-z%C3%A9.ogg)). I am a first-year PhD student at Booth School of Business, University of Chicago. I am honored to work with [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/) and [Alex Koch](https://alexkoch.site/).

I study cultural evolution. My research revolves around three broad questions. First, I ask why human psychology (e.g., human perception, prejudice) has taken its current form and how it co-evolves with social ecology as people adapt to their environments. Yet human societies are complex systems, not omniscient designers; what evolves can be adaptive within one context or under one evaluative criterion, but may malfunction when the context shifts or the evaluation standard changes—especially as systems scale or evolve at different speeds. Accordingly, my second line of research investigates these malfunctions, such as the loneliness epidemic, entrenched prejudice, political polarization, and backlash against globalization in modern societies. Third, to address these puzzles, I study how human communities can intentionally steer their own cultural evolution—for example, by deciding which practices to adopt, what ideas to spread, how information circulates, and how disagreements are managed. Taken together, my work aims to understand how we can build better forms of collective life.
