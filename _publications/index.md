Below is an introduction of my research by topics. You can find my published papers and preprints on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UCWX53IAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=5778974199078678248) page or a broader list of research projects in my [CV](https://yuanzeliu.github.io/files/LIU%20Yuanze_CV_20251027.pdf).

“Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains.” Rousseau's famous quote encapsulates my core research interest: understanding the dilemma between our inherent sociality and individuality. Humans, as social animals, are profoundly shaped by society, where we develop our defining traits like language and theory of mind. Yet, unlike eusocial species such as ants or bees, whose social roles are biologically fixed, humans are born with equal potential and eager to exert their autonomy. This ever-lasting tension gives rise to deep questions at intrapersonal, interpersonal, and societal levels. The complexity of these questions fuels my long-term passion for research.
